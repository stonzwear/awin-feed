They’ll never fall off on their own and feel as soft as a sock!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The flexible EVA construction allows natural movement without bulk, while the wide opening and adjustable strap make for quick on-and-off and a secure fit. From city streets to mountain trails and everywhere in between, the Trek keeps feet protected, supported, and ready for whatever the season brings.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="ewa-rteLine"&gt;The Trek Toddler Winter Boot has been redesigned to deliver greater comfort, support, and cold-weather performance. Now ultra-lightweight, it features a zero-drop sole, wider toe box and heel to support healthy foot development, and deep tread outsoles for improved grip on varied terrain. Cold-rated to -30°C/-22F, the Trek pairs a fully waterproof bottom with a water-resistant, insulated upper and plush faux fur lining for lasting warmth. The flexible EVA construction allows natural movement without bulk, while the wide opening and adjustable strap make for quick on-and-off and a secure fit. From city streets to mountain trails and everywhere in between, the Trek keeps feet protected, supported, and ready for whatever the season brings.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="ewa-rteLine"&gt;The Trek Toddler Winter Boot has been redesigned to deliver greater comfort, support, and cold-weather performance. Now ultra-lightweight, it features a zero-drop sole, wider toe box and heel to support healthy foot development, and deep tread outsoles for improved grip on varied terrain. Cold-rated to -30°C/-22F, the Trek pairs a fully waterproof bottom with a water-resistant, insulated upper and plush faux fur lining for lasting warmth. The flexible EVA construction allows natural movement without bulk, while the wide opening and adjustable strap make for quick on-and-off and a secure fit. From city streets to mountain trails and everywhere in between, the Trek keeps feet protected, supported, and ready for whatever the season brings.&lt;/div&gt;
